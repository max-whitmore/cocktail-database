# The Cocktail database üç∏üçπ

Using the https://www.thecocktaildb.com/ API I have created a wep page that allows you to search for cocktails. Once you find a cocktail of your choice, there is a cocktail page which lists different types of information about the cocktail including:

- name
- category
- glass to be served in
- instructions on how to make the cocktail
- ingredients
 
This is a small project that has taught me to use:
- ReactJS (BrowserRouter, Router, Route, Switch)
- React Router DOM 
- Working with a public API
- Introducing search functionality
